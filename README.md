# GitHub Pages Starter (Gift of Flowers)

This repository hosts your website via GitHub Pages.

## How to publish
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload these files to the repo (drag & drop on github.com).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch".
5. Set **Branch** to `main` and **/ (root)` then **Save**.
6. Wait 1–3 minutes for the build; the public URL will appear at the top of that page.

## Updating content
- Edit `index.html` directly on GitHub or upload a new version. GitHub will auto-redeploy.

## Notes
- `.nojekyll` prevents Jekyll from rewriting files.
- `404.html` is a simple not-found page.
